# Memory

Classic memory game. Choose a deck of cards: cats or dogs? Then turn two cards (Ooh, yes, they're animated). If they show the same picture, they're out of the game. If not, they face down again. Keep going until you've found all the pairs. The time, attempts and high score are displayed. Try to break the record.
